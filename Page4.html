   <h3 id="Testing">â€º Automated Testing</h3>
   <p>Some think that the only type of testing that is performed in TDD is the unit testing. While unit testing is the main type of testing in TDD, there are other types of testing that should be developed and automated as well. The three main types of automated testing in TDD are the following:</p>
   <ul>
   
   <li>
     <h6>Unite Testing </h6>
     <p>Unite testing tests individual functions or methods within a larger module or class. Unite testing ensures that every single unit in the code works according to its specification. A function may have multiple unit tests each testing a particular part of that function. All unite tests should be automated. Whenever a change is made into a paticular module, all unit tests should run again. </p>
   </li>
   
   <li>
     <h6>Integration Testing </h6>
     <p>Integration testing is an extremely important type of testing in TDD. It insures that all unites are still working as they should be when integrated. A lot of problems arise when two or more modules are brought together. Therefore, in TDD it is important to continuously integrate units and to develop automated test that insures all units are still working right. </p>
   </li>
   
   <li>
     <h6>Performance Testing </h6>
     <p>Although performance testing is not always used in TDD, it is still an important type of testing that should also be automated. Performance testing aims on testing the overall performance of the system when used by a large amount of users. There are many testing frameworks that can help simulating a large number of users accessing the system. The system should be tested using different scenarios and different levels of load. </p>
   </li>
   </ul>
