   <h3 id="Testing">› Benefits</h3>
   <p>There are a number of advantages to software development that TDD can achieve. Here I mention some of these advantages. </p>
  
   <ul>
   <li>
     <p> TDD promotes iterative development where you built software in a step-by-step basis. You identify a functionality that needs to be implemented, write a test for that functionality, implement the functionality to make the test pass, only if tests are passed, you start working on the next functionality. </p>
   </li>
   <li>
     <p> TDD increases your confidence in the software you are developing. You get instant and frequent feedback in how well your software works, whether the changes you’ve just made introduced problems, and whether the functionality you’ve just implemented works as expected when integrated to the system. If there are problems, you will know right a way and respond more easily to fix them. </p>
   </li>
   <li>
     <p> TDD produces a code that has less bugs and defects. That’s an obvious result of the intensive testing that is required by TDD. Every single feature/functionality that you implement is tested several times before integration as well as after integration. Therefore, it is expected to detect most bugs associated with the code being developed and fix these bugs more promptly and easily. </p>
   </li>
   <li>
     <p> TDD promotes refactoring. You can refactor your code without worrying whether the changes you are bout to made will break the code. This is because is you break something; you will immediately know by running all tests again. The fact that all tests in TDD are automated, makes refactoring cheaper to do. </p>
   </li>
   <li>
     <p> Since developers in TDD refactor code frequently, they produce simpler and cleaner designs which leads to better quality software. Also, a simpler design means easier to change, which is the overall goal of agile processes that asks developers to welcome user’s change requests. </p>
